Почему хорошее ИТ-образование невостребовано рыночком - Глушков Fest 2019

Company types:
1. Technology company (writing: platforms, database manage systems, operation systems)
To work in this companies you must have fundamental knowledge of computer science and extensive knowledge of paradigms, language, concepts

2. Product (something what we want to sell and it's bigger than doll shop)
To work here you must have good at something technology and use framework, library as well

3. Outsorce (sell human hours)
To work here you must understanding framework, library not necessarily deep, you're cookie cutter

4. shit company (too much routine tasks)
To work here you must have nothing, if you can writing some working simple code you're good for this company

You need to run somewhere your code, keep data and so one it's about infrastructure
infrasture types:
1. bare machine(bare metal)
When your execution instractions run directly on microcontroller. It's using for writing (boot operation system, memory manager, schedulers and so on)
Advantages:
- performance

Disadvantages:
- you need to reinvent some things to run your code, where in operation system it's in the box
- difficult to port to another machine
- problems with testing

2. shared hosting(common web-server)
When on one server places some website pages in internet
Advantages:
- the most common and the cheapest way to put your appllication in internet
Disadvantages:
- this solution isn't scaleble and flexible

3. virtualizing
When you run in one machine several instances servers, machines
Advantages:
- performance
- scaleble
- opensource solutions (virtual box, QEMU)

4. containerization
When you place your code in container enviroment (Docker, k8s) with some version of operation system and it can runs on different platforms without troubles

5. clustering
When you run one system on several machines
Advantages:
- reliablity

6. serverless
It's a cloud computing model. You don't need to worry about servers, storage, network. You only pay for machine resources (firebase)

Advantages:
- scaleble
- fast
- time to market is the highest

Disadvantages:
- it's too difficult to migrate to another solution

The main programming problems:
- solve domain problem
- cope with difficulty
- manage state
- architecture and structure

one way to solve domain problem is dsl
domain specific language
dsl - language to solve domain problem or problem in industry (html, sql)
Advantages:
- domain expertise
- improve code readablity
- increasing productivity

Disadvantages:
- you need to support this language, add features
- some task with another context isn't be able to solve issue
- fragmentation, making it harder to manage and maintain the overall software ecosystem

Formalization:
- patterns
- standarts RFC, ECMA, ISO
- models UML, ERD
- methodology
- formal languages

architecture means
- decomposition
- naming
- tying
