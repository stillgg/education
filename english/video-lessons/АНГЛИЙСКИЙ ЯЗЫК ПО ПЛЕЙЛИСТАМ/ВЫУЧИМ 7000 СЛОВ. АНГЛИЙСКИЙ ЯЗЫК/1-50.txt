The price went up

I love you with all my heart

I'm terribly sorry

They say that time is money

People say that time is money

I'm still waiting for it

I'll call you back later

Wait a second

He keeps his money in a bank

I put it on the floor

I want to travel around the world

I would do it in your place

I want to ask you a question

I wrote a comment

Are they rich?

Many things unite us

The baby is crying

I'm learning English

Nice to meet you

Nice to meet you, too
you, too

What else? Anything else?

I went there through the forest

Don't forget to do it

I left my bag at home

I don't care
