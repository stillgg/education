Passive and Active Voice

My mother works in a bank

Someone stole his laptop

You are asked the question

This decision was taken by him

Too little money is earned by him

The company produced these goods in China

This work will be finished soon

She is often praised

Someone stole his laptop

A new book was written by him

He earns too little money

These goods are produced in China

They will forget it soon

The channel was created a year ago

His laptop was stolen

He cancelled the meeting unexpectedly

We are taken their offer

They often showed it on TV

I will finish this work soon

She is often criticized

They found him alive

He created the channel two years ago

He was found alive

It will be forgotten soon 

Others respect him

They often criticize her

They said it very loudly

These things are produced in Japan

They stole this money

Other people often praise her

This money was stolen by them

He wrote a new book

He is respected

It was said very loudly

He will complete the task soon

It is often shown on TV

Their offer was taken
Their offer was accepted

They produce these things in Japan

The task will be completed soon

Everything is controlled by them

They control everything

The meeting was cancelled unexpectedly

He often sees her there

He is often seen there

They grow fruit and vegetables in their own garden

He was treated very rudely

I was born twenty years ago

Is it produced in China?

This money was returned by him

It seems to me he won't be able to achieve this aim

Fruit and vegetables are grown in their own garden

I translated this text very easily

I see that these two things are closely connected with each other

He doesn't spend enough time on it

They do nothing to change this situation

They don't do anything to change this situation
