Everything is being controlled now

It has just been done

The next level will be reached quite soon

As It seems to me, everything has just been done properly

They'll be informed tomorrow

He's being criticized very sharply these days

She said that all the mistakes had been corrected

These figures are being analized now

I suppose that the next level will have been reached by the end of this month

Not everything was understood immediately

He said that the problem had been solved

I was waiting while his work was being checked

When I came there, very important things were being disscussed

It was found out that the bag had been stolen

As it has already been said the situation isn't so simple

As it seems to me, this work will have been finished by tomorrow

It was said that he had been awarded

It has already been said

He said that not everything had been understood correctly

As it has already been mentioned, not everything depends on us
