Have you already finished doing it

My dream is to communicate with different people from other countries

The thieves were caught by the police

He said that he had grown up in the UK

He doesn't agree with you now

They will have repaired the watch by next week

Why is she crying?

This group of people supports him

He's supported by this group of people

As it seems to me that she lacks proffessionalism and deep knowledge

This channel was created by him a year ago

It has just been announced

The fence was painted yesterday

He was valued and respected

As I see, everything functions properly

The criminals didn't manage to escape from the police

It was protected by copyrights

There is no need to lenghten this course

Subtract 10 from 20 and you will get the figure

I have to say that I faced different difficulties on my way

The file has just been downloaded

He mostly dealt with suppliers

He's acting like a baby now

Stop complaining all the time!

He said that he had voted for the second candidate

Let me explain it to you!
