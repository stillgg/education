We all see that this business is expanding now

When I entered the room, he was shouting at someone

How much money was donated?

I've just confused these words

He said that they had been building this house for two month

It was said that he had been shot

He said that the building had been destroyed that year

What impressed you most all?

This crime was prevented by the police

He prefers to combine different methods when he learns English

The present was wrapped very carefully

I've just been congratulated

He said that he had failed the test

Such problems are often ignored

They decided to explore the island

They were arrested by the police

I've been using this application for about a year

He has just been given this money

I just wanted to express my point of view

A very deep hole was dug by someone

I was born in this city

This medicine was prescribed by my doctor

Welcome to this party!

He said that he hadn't registered yet

You need to cross the street over there
