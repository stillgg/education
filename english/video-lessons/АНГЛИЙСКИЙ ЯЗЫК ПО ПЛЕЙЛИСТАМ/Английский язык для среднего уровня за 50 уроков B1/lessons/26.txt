I've been thinking about it since morning

What is he staring at?

Some of the costs were minimized

We've been walking in the park since morning

The parcel has just been delivered

It was said that he had violated the law

As I've already said, I had thrown it away

How long have you been dating?

I hung my jacket there

He said that it had saved her life

Could you help me move the box?

He said that he had hurt his knee

When I start talking to him about it, he always tries to change the subject

He told me that he had bought a new house

The police came to the conclusion that he had committed that crime

When the boy saw a stranger, he turned and ran away

As we see, he was really frightened

He was helped and supported

He drew a very beautiful picture. It looked like a real masterpiece

First of all, I'd like to thank you for coming

I had already woken up by the time he called me

He hugged her very tightly

As we all know, happiness is often associated with money but it isn't really so

I see this dress suits you perfectly

I've been thinking about it since yesterday 

It reminds me of my first trip to the United States
