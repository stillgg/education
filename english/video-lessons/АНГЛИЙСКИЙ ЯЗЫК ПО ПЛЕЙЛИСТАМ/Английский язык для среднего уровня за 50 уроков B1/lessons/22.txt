I've been really worried about for the last few days

I've just shared this link with some of my friends

The soup smells very good

Unfortenately, the bomb didn't explode
or
Luckily, the bomb didn't explode

I felt very relieved because I had overcome all those difficulties in the end

This offer sounds very suspicious now

I've always liked doing this kind of things

When I saw him, he was looking for something

It took me several days to discover a solution to such a difficult task

He said that he had served in the army

This work will have been completed by next year

As it seems to me, he knows what he's doing now

I was advised not to do it

I need to measure the size of the room

The plane hasn't landed yet

They've just offered him this job

This trend is getting more and more popular nowadays

He was going home, when I met him

The company is going to double its sales this year

He said that he had laid his bag on the floor

It was stored in a small container

She called him when he was driving a car

I would like to emphasize the importance of this event
