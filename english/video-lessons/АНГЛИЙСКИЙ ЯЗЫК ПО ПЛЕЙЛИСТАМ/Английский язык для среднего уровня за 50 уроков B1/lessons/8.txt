When they arrived, we had been discussing these issues for about two hours

I've been working here since I graduated from university

He had been studying incredibly hard for a couple of weeks before he passed his final exam

I will have reached the next level by the time I finish this course

They will have been living together for four years by next month

He had been learning English very intensively for three years before he reached an Advanced level in English

They will have been living in America for five years by the end of this month

By the time he came home, she had been cooking for two hours

I expect that I will have earned this sum of money by next year

I've been waiting for a very long time

When he called me I had been doing that job for about fifteen minutes

I will have been working here for a year by August

He will have reached the next level by that time he finishes studying this course

He expects that he will have earned this sum of money by next year

I've been waiting for it for so long

How long have you been studying here?

I've been waiting for it for an hour. I can't wait for it anymore
