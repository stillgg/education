I had been working for three hours when he came to the office

I had been looking for my keys for about twenty minutes before I found it

When she came home, I had been watching that movie for about an hour

I will have been doing this course for three months by that time

I will have been here for three days by next week

I will have been working here for about two months by next year

She had been looking for her bag for almost two hours before I found it

I will have been travelling for two days by that time she sees us

When he called me, I had been watching that video for about half an hour

I had been learning English for two years before I reached an Intermediate level

I will have been staying here for two days by next week

I will have been studying here for two years by that time

I will have been studying at university for two years by next year

She will have been studying at university for three years by next year

I had already been doing that course for two weeks by that time

I had been cooking for about an hour when the phone rang

I will have been working here for a year by next week
