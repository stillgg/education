He's been teaching English for about ten years

As you can see, everything is being controlled now

He said that they had been living together for two years

He said that he had lost the ticket

He said that this aim had already been achieved

He says that he can't guarantee anything at the moment

It goes without saying that it's very easy to judge other people

I'd like to ask you what it means

He decided that he would shorten his speach

I've been trying to arrange a meeting with him for the last few days but without success

What influenced you most of all

She said that they had jumped over the fence

The food tastes so good

He notid that one more copy would be sent to us

Our group was divided into three parts

It was discribed very vividly in this book

He promised that he would present these materials to us

She was advised to stop panicking

He was afraid that it would limit his freedom

He kicked the ball very hard
I'm going to attend this meeting. And you?

What do they acccuse him of?

I was greeted very warmly

He was so angry that he tore the papers

She introduced him to her parents
