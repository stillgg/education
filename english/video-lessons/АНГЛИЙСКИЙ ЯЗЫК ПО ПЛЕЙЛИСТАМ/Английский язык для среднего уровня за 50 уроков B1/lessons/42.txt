I seriously doubt that he'll have enough detemination to do it

When we were staying there, we decided to rent a car

I din't know why he had refused to help her

I've been trying to get in touch with him for the last few days

Those products are exported

Their new album was recorded last month

Are you subscribed to this channel

He said that it had been snowing since morning

When he called me I was searching for it online

I felt that I needed to improve my listening skills

I was so happy that I had passed that exam

He was threatened

I know that I mustn't be late for work

These goods are imported

They accused him of that crime but he denied all the accusations

You need to fasten the belt

No one was punished

She hasn't fed the kids yet

He hasn't unfastened the belt yet

How much money does he owe you?

I haven't typed all the text yet

If I were you, I wouldn't rely on him

Something strange was written there

I answered that I would take his offer with great pleasure

I've already started doing this course
