I can hardly believe this news

I suggest meeting tonight if you don't mind, of corse

He exclaimed something but I didn't hear it

They tried not to quarrel and they live quite peacefully

Their sales rose by twenty per cent

He said that he had arrived late as usual

I have to say that I really enjoy communicating with people from other countries using English

She said that it had ruined her life

He thought that she would disapprove of that decision

I tend to think that it's inevitable

She said that she would try to cook something very tasty

I expect that this level will have been reached by the end of the year

No one really cares about it

I sent them a letter but no one replied

She's just cleared the table

I've been trying to learn English since childhood

I have to confess that it is rather difficult to remain calm in such a situation

She said that she hadn't swept the floor yet

I withdrew this sum of money for my personal needs

When we arrived there, we heard that the neighbours were arguing about something

He said that the news had saddened her greatly

If I were you, I would try to be more careful

He said that they had been married for three years

The company hired two more emploeys who will work in this department

How did he react to this idea?
