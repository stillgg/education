He said that he had pressed the button

I'm absolutely sure that you deserved this success

He prayed to God and his dream came true

She said that she would sing her favorite song

They haven't calculated all the costs yet

It was sometimes said that smoking really kills

He pushed the door and entered the room

He said that he would keep this secret

When I saw them, they were sitting and chatting with each other

He was warned about it

I'm not going to disturb you

He fell off the bike and hurt his leg

If you need anything, just let me know

It was impossible to predict such sudden changes

I persuaded him to buy another model

I try to devote more time to my hobbies if it's possible, of course

I've just printed this document

He's been boasting about his recent achievements for the last few days
