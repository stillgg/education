He's acting like a baby now

I have to say that I faced with different difficulties on my way

He's supported by this group of people

As it seems to me, she lacks professionalism and deep knowledge

As I see everything functions properly

Why is she crying

The thieves were caught by the police

The criminals didn't manage to escape from the police

This channel was created by him a year ago

Let me explain it to you

The fence was painted yesterday

It's protected by copyright

He said that he had grown up in the UK

The file has just been downloaded

They will have repaired the watch by next week

He doesn't agree with you now

It has just been announced

He mostly dealt with suppliers

Have you already finished doing it?

My dream is to communicate with different people from other countries

Stop complaing all the time!

There is no need to lengthen this course

Subtract 10 from 20 and you'll get this figure

He's valued and respected

He said that he had voted for the second candidate
