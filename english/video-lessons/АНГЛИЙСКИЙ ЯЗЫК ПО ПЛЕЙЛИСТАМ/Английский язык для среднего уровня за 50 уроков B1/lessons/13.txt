wrap

The present was wrapped very carefully

He prefers to combine different methods when he learns English

He said that he had failed the test

It was said that he had been shot

He has just been given this money

This medicine was prescribed by my doctor

I just wanted to express my point of view

He said that the building had been destroyed that year

What impressed you most of all?

How much money was donated?

We all see that this business is expanding now

Such problems are often ignored

I've been using this application for about a year

I have just been congratulated

You need to cross the street over there

Welcome to this party!

He said that they had been building this house for two months

They decided to explore the island

A very deep hole was dug by someone

I've just confused these words

This crime was prevented by the police

When I entered the room, he was shouting at someone

They were arrested by the police

I was born in this city

He said that he hadn't registered yet
