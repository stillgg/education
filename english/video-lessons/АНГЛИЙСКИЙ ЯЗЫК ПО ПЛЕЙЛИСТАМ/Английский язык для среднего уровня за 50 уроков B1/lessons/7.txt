I've been waiting for it for an hour. 
I can't wait for it anymore

I've been waiting for it for so long

I've been waiting for a very long time

When he called me, I had been doing that job for about fifteen minutes

When they arrived, we had been discussing these issues for about two hours

He had been learning English very intensively for three years before he reached an Advanced level in English

He had been studying incredibly hard for a couple of weeks before he passed his final exam

I will have reached the next level by that time I finish this course

He expects that he will have earned this sum of money by next year

They will have been living in America for five years by the end of this month

I will have been working here for a year by August

They will have been living together for four years by next month

Hw will have reached the next level by the time he finishes studying this course

By the time he came home, she had been cooking for two hours

I expect that I will have earned this sum of money by next year

How long have you been studying here?

I've been working here since I graduated from university
