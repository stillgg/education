My dream is to visit this country one day

He disagreed with this statement

The keys haven't been found yet

It's expected that these problems will be solved soon

We saw that the shop was closed

By the time she comes, he will have already been doing his homework for two hours

Who does this house belong to?

Everything was explained very clearly

I will do it if you don't mind

He says that he's going to participate in this competition

It's mentioned in the previous video

It has just been sold

I will have listened to this recording by tomorrow

He said that money had never motivated him

Such measures led the company to bankruptcy

I'm still considering this offer

It wasn't so easy to lift that bag

To be honest, I've never had this kind of experience

I'll try to do my best to cope with all these difficulties

The conflict was resolved successfully

The book has been published this year

I expect that he will have entered this university by autumn

Their new album will be released this year

It might change your point of view

They have been competing with each other for a very long time
