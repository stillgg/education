The ship sank unexpectedly

He said that he would join us

Let's continue talking about it!

I hope that everything will get back to normal soon

I've been reading this book for about two weeks

His name wasn't included in the list

The situation could be worse now

When will this program be installed

I have to say that it stimulated him only in the beginning

He nodded approvingly

He's just swum across the river

I've just sat down

This file was attached to the letter

The office is located in this area

Who won in the end?

I wasn't able to contact him by phone

I haven't adapted to these conditions yet

It was said that he had broken the law

By the time he came, I had already been staying at home for two hours

As I see, so many things unite us

Hi was asked to clean the room

How much money was invested in this project

The troops were attacked by the enemy

What does he suffer on?

What can you say about hunting?

What do you think about all this?
