I suppose, the will have built the bridge by next summer

I'll be waiting for the latest news

The plane will have landed by that time

He will have finished school by next year

I'll be having a rest while he's preparing for this exam

While he's writing this report, I'll be analizing some other figures

I'll be waiting for your call

I'll be waiting for your message

While they're having a rest, I'll be working

I'll be waiting for your answer

I will have finished watching this video by that time she comes

I'll be waiting for your email

I will have finished writing this report by that time he comes home

He will have come to the office by ten

He will be comming to the office

I expect, they will have finished constructing the bridge by next season

While he's staying at home, I'll be playing with my friends
