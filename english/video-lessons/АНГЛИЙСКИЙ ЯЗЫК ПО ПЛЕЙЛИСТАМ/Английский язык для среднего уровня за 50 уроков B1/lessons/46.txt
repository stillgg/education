What does success depend on?

When he was a teenager, he never dreamt about being a millinonare

My knowledge was tested and they told me that my level was above average

She said that she had already cut the cake

While he was walking along the beach, he saw a coin and picked it up

It's reported in the news

This problem concerns all of us now

As far as I know, he's currently studying this 

It's written that it's made in Japan

I can't understand what you are laughing at?

It won't be shown on TV

I graduated from university for a very long time

It's reported that his money had been stolen

By the time I called him, he had already returned home

If I'm not mistaken, someone has just knocked the door

The conference will be organized next month

To be perfectly honest, it exceeded my expectations

This information has just been confirmed

The monastery is being rebuilt now

I don't really remember how it all began

It appears to me these measures aren't appropriate at present

They had to replace all the furniture which had been damaged during the fire

All the food has just been eaten

She's just washed her face

Certainly, I wish I had more free time. 
It's a natural desire
