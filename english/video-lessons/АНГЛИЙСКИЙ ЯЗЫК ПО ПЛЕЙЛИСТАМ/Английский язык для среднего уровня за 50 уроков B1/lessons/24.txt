As it's written, this toy requires two batteries

As I see, I need to focus more on my career

He said that it had really shocked him

The files have just been deleted

As for his qualities, I admire his determination, courage and bravery

You need to understand that this kind job involves lots of time and patience

You need to know that you risk losing everything

As it was reported, all the crew had survived

I've just been asked about it

My opinion is that they need to behave more responsibly

The meeting was canceled

I don't believe him now. He's just pretending

He says that he dislikes this kind of treatment

He hasn't recovered from this desease yet

It was said that the building had been damaged very badly

He tried to insist on following his recommendation but I did what I wanted

I don't think this thing really matters now

She said that she would try to forgive him

He was named after his father

I have to add that I succeeded in passing the test

He was easily manipulated
He's easy to manipulate

If you don't hurry up you can miss the buss

He was valued and loved

I'll try to practise speaking English more regularly when I have free time
