I was recommended to read this book

This news was surprised me so much

He was asked to hold that bag

Their results are often compared

He was known as a very successful businessman

Where can I exchange my dollars for euros

I would follow this advice in your place

I decided to hesitate a bit before taking the final decision

Could you repeat your question?

The wind is blowing now so stongly now

I truly appreciate your kindness

They kissed in the end

She said that he had borrowed this sum of money

I've been training very intensively for the last two days

I've never promised this kind of things

How long have you been waiting for him?

He was often praised

She's just smiled at me

She hasn't watered the flowers yet

I've never experienced such a feeling

I could characterize him as a very ambitious person

The woman is being watched now

How many times a day do you brush your teeth?

He said that he had locked the door

He can't afford to buy a new apartment at the moment
