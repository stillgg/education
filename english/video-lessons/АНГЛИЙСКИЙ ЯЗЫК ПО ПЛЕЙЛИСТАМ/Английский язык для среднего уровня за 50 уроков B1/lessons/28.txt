He said that he had ordered us a taxi

He didn't have time to shave

He said that he'd like to relax a bit

His success really inspired me to go ahead

To be frank, I can hardly imagine it

This country is provided with oil and gas

It was noted that some very important facts were missing

Unfortunately, their marriage ended in divorce

He said that he had climbed over the fence

As it was said she died of heart attack

He says that he approves of this choice

You need to choose the correct answer
As we can see, the farm extends along the river

She was forbidden to leave a house

I have to admit that it wasn't my initiative

What's your attitude towards cheating

They fought for freedom and independence and they succeed in it in the end

We will have been playing for two hours by six

He paused for a minute and then he continued talking

It's expacted that he'll be promoted next year

I stopped for a while and drank a glass of juice

I may be late for the meeting a bit

Have you already decorate a Cristmas tree

As it was writteng smoking isn't allowed here
