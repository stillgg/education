He owns this business now

She said that he had remembered his name

He said that he needed to fly to London

She said that she had put the keys on the table

trust
If I were you I wouldn't trust these statistics

The money was lent him

Not enough was said about it

He says that the insurance won't cover these loses

It was supposed that he had won
He's supposed to win

The kettle is boiling

When he understood that he had forgotten to take something he started unpacking his things

I saw that she was mixing the ingredients very slowly

He tries to pretend that this problem doesn't exist but it isn't so

He said that it had spoilt his plans

She said that she had put the keys on the table
