When I saw him, he was carrying a very heavy bag

What delayed you

I managed to solve such a difficult task with his help

I'd like to comment on this problem

It was regulated by the government

You need to analyze this data more thoroughly

The soldiers burnt the bridge

She found out that he had been deceiving her for years

Don't blame him for it!

This letter hasn't been received yet

I can't afford to buy it at the moment

He was also invited to the party

Nothing has been forgotten since that time

She's loved and respected

I don't quite understand what you're talking about

Have you ever ridden a camel?
