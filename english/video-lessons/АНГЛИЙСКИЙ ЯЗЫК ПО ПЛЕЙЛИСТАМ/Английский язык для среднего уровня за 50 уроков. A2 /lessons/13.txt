include
They included his name in the list

He said that the latest news had surprised him greatly

While we were walking in the park, they were staying at home

I've never experienced such a feeling

They're going to increase the price

To be honest, I've never seen anything like it before

I saw him at the party

He told us that he had lost wallet somewhere

She said that she had failled the test

This year they released a new album

They've released a new album this year

They often criticize him for no reason at all

I guessed the correct answer

I've already guessed the correct answer

When he speaks English, he lacks confidence but I think that it's just a matter of practice

I've just written this report

They're sitting on the floor and talking about something

They've already painted the wall

The car has just broken down

His car often broke down

She taught us English, but I didn't really understand it

I've already started this course

I greatly improved my English with the help of this method

I hope that I will find a better job soon

I hope that the situation will improve soon
