When I have free time, I usually devote it to my family

If I have free time, I usually devote it to my hobbies

If it rains, I usually stay at home

When you train too much, you get tired very quickly

If water reaches one hundred degrees, it boils

I get tired if I work too much

If I learn English regularly, I feel real progress

If he calls me, I'll be very surprised

If it rains, I'll stay at home

If it happens, It'll be very strange

She'll be very disappointed if she knows it

He'll be shocked if he knows the truth

If you study really hard, you'll pass the exam

If you don't hurry up, you'll be late

If it rains, they can cancel the match

If the situation doesn't improve, they'll need to take some urgent measures

If I earn enough money, I'll be able to buy it

If nothing changes, the situation will be very unpleasant

If everything remains the same, nothing good will happen

If you train more intensively, you'll show a much better result
