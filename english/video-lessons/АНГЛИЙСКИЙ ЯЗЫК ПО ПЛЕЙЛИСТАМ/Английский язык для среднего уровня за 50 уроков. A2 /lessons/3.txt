When she called me, I was having a rest

When he called me, I was staying at home

When I got a call from him, I was walking somewhere in the park

When I saw them, they were playing at the stadium

When I came home, she was cooking something

She was cooking something very tasty when I came home

When she called me, I was thinking about her

When I was working, they were having a rest

When I was trying to fall asleep, I heard a very strange noise

When I was trying to fall asleep, the boys were playing very loudly

When I was trying to fall asleep, the men were talking about something very loudly

While we were waiting, we were getting more and more nervous

We were getting more and more nervious while we were waiting for the exam results

While we were waiting for this announcement, we were getting more and more nervous

I was watching this video yesterday at this time

I was reading a very thrilling story yesterday at 3 o'clock in the afternoon

I was working all day yesterday

I was learning English all day yesterday

I was staying at home all day yesterday

What were you doing there? I was waiting for my friend

The sun was shining very brightly and the birds were singing

When I woke up, the sun was shining very brightly

When I came home, I drank a cup of tea

When I came home, I fell asleep

He fell asleep when he came home

I was waiting for your message

I was waiting for your answer with impatience

To tell the truth, I was waiting for your answer with impatience

To tell the truth, I was waiting for this news with impatience
