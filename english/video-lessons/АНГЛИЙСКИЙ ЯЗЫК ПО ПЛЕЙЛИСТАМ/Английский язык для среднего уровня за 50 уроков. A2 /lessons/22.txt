Have you ever considered this opportunity?

He burnt the letter

You need to press the button

I can rely on him

I need to add one very important thing

Press the button!

The most important thing is to be able to communicate with other people using English

When he opened the door, he saw a stranger

To be frank, I've never considered this opportunity

It means that we need to be more careful

She offered me a cup of tea

As for English, the most important thing is to be able to communicate with others using this language

I've already given him some advice

I expect that the next time it'll be different

He needs to clean the car

Someone was knocking at the door

I looked at them and saw that they were behaving very strangely

She said that she had read that book

I can always rely on him

What do you mean

When will you return home

This speach really inspired the audience

Did they really kill him?

They provide excellent conditions

It brought me lots of positive emotions
