What were you doing when you saw it

I got more interested in this kind of issues

When it happened to me, I started thinking about it much more seriously

When I studied at university, my friends and I often discussed it

It was a very difficult situation. I was working really hard. I was trying to do my best to earn enough money to live on

It started raining, and we decided to go home

It was such a difficult situation. I was working so much. I was trying to do my best to earn enough money for a living

When it happened, I started thinking about it more seriously

When it started snowing so heavily, I decided to cancel that meeting

The situation was getting out of control and, to be honest, I didn't know what to do

When I saw him, I asked him that question

When I was waiting for him, I was revising the lesson

What were you doing, when such an unpleasant thing happened?

When it started raining so heavily, I decided not to go there

I revised all the lessons

When I studied at school, I didn't pay attention to it

It was snowing all day
