I've just arrived at the meeting

lie lay lain

He lay down at the end of the day

I decided not to follow this recommendation

Why is he smiling?

I discovered that they had given me the wrong information

I was staying at home all day

I was at home all day

steal stole stolen
He discovered that someone had stolen his bag

Did you wash the dishes?

It seems to me that it developes our analytical abilities

It was getting darker and we decided to turn back home

The teacher divided our group into several parts

I divided this sum of money into three parts

I've already tested my knowledge

When did he graduate from university

I haven't prepared for this test yet

While I was preparing for this test really hard, they weren't thinking about it really seriously

I remember how it happened

I disagree with statement now

He said, that they had destroyed the building completely

Such an example really motivates me

I think that we're wasting time now

When I noticed him, he was looking for something

What are you looking for?
