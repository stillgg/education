What size do you wear

As far as I understand, I need to practise speaking English as much as possible

I've already subscribed to this channel

As I understand, you woke up very early yesterday

I've just drunk a cup of tea

It seems to me, you misunderstood it

Let me explain it to you!

When I called him, he was driving a car

Let me tell you one thing!

Let's continue!

The bell rang and it woke me up

He hasn't corrected this mistake yet

He decided to kiss her

The often laughed at him and it was so humiliating

What is your size?

She understood that they had deceived her

Look! It's snowing

He said that they had analized it very thouroughly

I heard that the police had arrested him

They fought like real heroes

I've just downloaded this file

They cancelled this flight very unexpectedly

As I see, I can't park here
