When I saw him, he was standing behind the door

He stood up immideately when he saw her

I've just entered the building

He said that he had entered a very prestigious university

They damaged this building very badly

I dealt with different people at work

I've never dealt with this kind of problems

He was celebrating his birthday all day

I've always wanted to have this kind of job

I've just sent her a message

I sent her a letter about an hour ago

They stopped talking

I doubt that it'll ever happen

This news sounds really strange

Who is winning now?

He fell and hurt his knee

He haven't passed that exam yet

I expect that that they'll publish this report soon
