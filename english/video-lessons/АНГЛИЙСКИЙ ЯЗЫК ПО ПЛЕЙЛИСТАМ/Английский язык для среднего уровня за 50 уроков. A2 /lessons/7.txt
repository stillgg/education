I was so happy because I had passed the test successfully

When I came home, she had already cooked dinner

By the time I finished school I had already reached an Intermediate level in English'

I had already left home by the time they arrived

I understood that I had made a mistake

He said that he had failed the test

She told me that no one had noticed it 

I knew that they had deceived her

I found out that they had deceived him

I found out that they had told me a lie

I had finished doing it by that time

I had finished doing everything by three o'clock

When he arrived at the airport, the plane had already taken off

When she arrived at the airport, the plane hadn't landed yet

I had finished everything by the time she called me

I had finished watching that video by the time they came to me

She said that he had won but I didn't believe her

He said that he had never been there but it looked very strange

I told him that I had improved my English significantly thanks to this method

She said that she had never been to such a beautiful place because it looked like a real paradise
