She said that he had gone home

He's just flown to the United States

I trust him completely

I knew that he had died very young

I really hate doing it

Someone called him when he was going home

Who doest it belong to now?

I suggest meeting tonight

The dress fit her perfectly

These clothes fit him perfectly

They've just repaired the roof

It seems to me that the water is boiling

I met him while I was walking in the park

He appeared at the end of the party

I suggest going for a walk

He said that she had reacted to these words very strangely

I asked him to repeat this question

How do you prefer to spend your free time

He left Russia last year

I was studying all day

I've always admired this kind of people

Don't touch it!

He's just invited me to this party
