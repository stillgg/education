I forgot to attach this document to the letter

I realize how important it is

I really like spending time with my friends

Who is calling you?

While she was cutting the pie, the children were waiting for it with imptience

I've compared it many times

I've compared these two possible alternatives so many times

Are you working today?

I've always liked doing it

I haven't bought it yet, because it costs so much now

By the time the police arrived, the police had already disappeared 

I fed my cat two hours ago

She grew up in the United States

I received this notification

I realize how serious it is

I felt that something was wrong

They defended their rights

I haven't learnt all these expressions yet

I attached two files to the letter

I tried to do my best to finish doing it by the end of the week

Has she already fed the children?

She said that she had spent her last money

Everything seems so strange now
