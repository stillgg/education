I had finished everything by the time she called me

When he had arrived at the airport, the plane had already taken off

When I came home, she had already cooked dinner

When She arrived at the airport, the plane hadn't landed yet

I told him that I had improved my English significantly thanks to this method

I knew that it had already happened

I found out, that they had told me a lie

I found out, that they had deceived him

He said that he had won

She said that he had won but I didn't believe her

I knew that they had deceived her

I understood that I had made a mistake

I was so happy because I had passed the test successfully

He said that he had never been there but it looked very strange

I had finished doing it by that time

I had finished doing everything by three o'clock

I had finished watching that video by the time they came to me

I had already left home by the time they arrived

She told me that no one had noticed it

He said that he had failed the test

By the time I finished school, I had already reached an Intermidiate level in English

She said that she had never been to such a beautiful place because it looked like a real paradise
