She taught us English but I didn't really understand it

He said that the latest news had surprised him greatly

They're sitting on the floor and talking about something

She said that she had failed the test

He told us that he had lost his wallet somewhere

I guessed the correct answer

I've already guessed the correct answer

They've already painted the wall

I saw him at the party

The car has just broken down

They often criticize him for no reason at all

I've never experienced such a feeling

I've already started this course

I hope that the situation will improve soon

To be honest, I've never seen anything like it before

I hope that I'll find a better job soon

His car often broke down

They've released a new album this year

They included his name in the list

When he speaks English, he lacks confidence but I think that it's just a matter of practice

I've just written this report

While we were walking in the park, they were staying at home

They're going to increase the price

I greatly improved my English with the help of this method

He lost his wallet somewhere
