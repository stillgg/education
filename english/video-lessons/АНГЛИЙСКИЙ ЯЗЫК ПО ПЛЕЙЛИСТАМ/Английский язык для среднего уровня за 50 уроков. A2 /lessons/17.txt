grow grew grown

She grew up in the USA

I haven't learnt all these expressions yet

I tried to do my best to finish doing it by the end of the week

Who is calling you?

By the time the police arrived, the men had already disappeared

I fed my cat two hours ago

Has she already fed the children

She said that she had spent her last money

I realize how important it is

I realize how serious it is

I realize how (risky / dangerous) it is

I've always liked doing

I really like spending time with my friends

I felt that something was wrong

Are you working today?

I forgot to attach this document to the letter

I attached two files to the letter

I received this notification

It all depends on you now?

I remember that I saved these files

They defended their rights

I haven't bought it yet because it costs so much now

Everything seems so strange now

While she was cutting the pie, the children were waiting for it with impatience

I've compared it many times

I've compared these two possible alternatives so many times
