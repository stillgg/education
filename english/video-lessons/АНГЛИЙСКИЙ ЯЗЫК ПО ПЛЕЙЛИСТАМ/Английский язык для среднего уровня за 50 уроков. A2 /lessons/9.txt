I have always wanted to visit an English-speaking country

I told him that I had always wanted to go to an English-speaking country

When I saw them, they were arguing about something

I explained it to him

When he explained everything to me, I realized that I had made a mistake

I've never been to China

He said that he had never been to China before

Time wasd passing very slowly.
We were waiting and waiting.
Everything was very uncertain

I haven't reached a strong Intermidiate level in English yet but it's in my plans

I haven't reached an Intermediate level in English yet but I'm going to do it soon

I haven't achieved this aim yet, but I'm going to do it in the near future

I haven't solved this problem yet, but I'm going to do something about it in the near future

It didn't live up to my expectations

He said that the performance hadn't lived up to his expectations

I have just got a message from him

I remembered that I had left the keys at home

I've never seen anything like it before

We all understood that it was the best offer because we had never seen anything like it before

When I saw it for the first time, I was really shocked

I didn't pay attention to it in the beginning but then I understood the seriousness of this problem

I haven't decided it yet

She said that she had never experienced such a feeling before

To tell the truth, I've never had these kind of problems

To be honest, I've always wanted to do something useful and meaningful in my life
