When I was trying to fall sleep I heard a very strange noise

When He called me I was staying at home

When I was trying to fall asleep, the men were talking about something very loudly

I was reading a very thrilling story yesterday at 3 o'clock in the afternoon

When I woke up, the sun was was shining very brightly

When I came home, she was cooking something

He fell asleep, when he came home

I was watching this video yesterday at this time

When I came home, I drank a cup of tea

While we were waiting for this announcement, we were getting nevious more and more

I was working all day yesterday

I was waiting for your message

When I came home, I fell asleep

When I was trying to fall asleep the boys were playing very loudly

She was cooking something very tasty, when I came home

When she called me, I was having a rest

I was waiting for your answer with impatience

What were you doing there?

While we were waiting, we were getting more and more nervious

To tell the truth, I was waiting for this news with impatience

I was learning English all day yesterday

When she called me, I was thinking about her

What were you doing there? I was waiting for my friend

When I got a call from him, Iwas walking somewhere in the park

To tell the truth, I was waiting for your answer with impatience

When I was working, they were having a rest

We were getting more and more nervious, while we were waiting for the exam results

The sun was shining very brightly and the birds were sining

I was staying at home all day yesterday

When I saw them, they were playing at the stadium
