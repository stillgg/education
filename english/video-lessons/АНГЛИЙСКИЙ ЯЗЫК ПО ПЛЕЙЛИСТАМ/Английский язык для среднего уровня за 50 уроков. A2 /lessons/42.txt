I think, it could happen to each of us

They ought to take more decisive measures

He might agree to do it

I could spend all day on it

Can you speak English

I won't be able to come so early

Can you help me?

I can't remember it

I think, you should tell him about it

We can't deny this fact

I understand that I must do it on a regular basis

Could you help me, please?

I'm sure that I'll be able to do it

It may happen quite soon

I would say it now

I think he could help us now

I'm sure that I'll be able to learn English sooner or later

Could you help me?

I think he should think about it more seriously

I have to get up so early because of my work

Do you think I should do it right now?
