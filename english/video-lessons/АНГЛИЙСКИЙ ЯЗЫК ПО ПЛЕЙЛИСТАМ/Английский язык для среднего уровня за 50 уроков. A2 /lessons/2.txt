Have you ever been to America?

I've always wanted to succeed in life

You know, I've been there so many times

I've been there several times

To be honest, I've never been to an English-speaking country but I'm going to do it one day

Were you in America last year?

When were you there?

Have you been abroad?

I've been there many times

Have you ever been to an English-speaking country?
I haven't been there yet but it's in my plans

Were you in China two years ago?

I haven't found anything suitable yet

I've always wanted to devote more free time to it

I've already sent him this message

Have you ever been to Italy? I was there last year

I've just arrived in England

Have you ever been to this country

As I know, he released this album about a year ago

I've never thought about it

When were you there last time?

Have you ever been to China?

Have you ever been abroad?

She's always wanted to study psychology

Have you ever been to Latin America?
I haven't been there yet

He's never been abroad

You know, I've always wanted to succeed in life

I haven't achieved this aim yet

Have you ever been to this city?

You know, I've heard it so many times

As I know, they've already taken proper measures

Have you ever been to an English-speaking country?
Not yet but it's in my plans

He's invited me to him many times

Have you ever been to the United States?
I was there two years ago

She's already mentioned it during the conversation

Have you been to India?

I've just arrived at the airport

To be honest, I've never considered it really seriously

You know, I've heard it a thousand times

Have you ever been to England?

He's just arrived at the party

I haven't done it yet

He's already mentioned it during his conversation

As I know, they released this album about a month ago

Have you ever been to Spain? Not yet

Have you ever been to the United States?
