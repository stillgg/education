He's just arrived at the party

He's already mentioned it during his conversation 

She's already mentioned it during the conversation

As I know, they've already taken proper measures

She's always wanted to study psychology

I've always wanted to devote more free time to it

I've always wanted to succeed in life

I've never heard about it

I've never thoght about it

To be honest, I've never considered it really seriously

To be honest, I've never been there yet, but I'm goin to do it one day

You know, I've heard it a thousand times

You know, I've heard it so many times
