The police caught a very dangerous criminal

What do you prefer to listen to in your free time?

It can lead to new problems

He could play football all day

Have they already delivered the goods?

I think you should look after your health

I think He could tell us this secret

I haven't installed this program yet

He might come to the party tomorrow

We've already discussed everything

I would do the same

While he was running, they were jumping

It may happen soon

I see that it really matters now

He threw him a ball

It immediately attracted my attention

I didn't need this thing so I threw it away

They lent him a very big sum of money

I'm trying to install this program now

They voted for the second candidate

He said that they hadn't discussed it yet

I can't guarantee anything at the moment

I withdrew all the money from my account

What kind of music do you like listening to?

I know that I must work on my mistakes
