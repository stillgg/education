What will you advise me to do in such a situation

The girl draws so beautifully

The boy kicked the ball

I don't know what to do now

They were building a house very slowly

Someone hit the door very badly

I've never dreamt about it

He said that he had sold his car

You can always count on my support

I suppose that I'll reach the next level quite soon

I've always wanted to live here

I never dreamt about it when I was a child

He hasn't replied to my message yet

You can count on my support

I've just spoken English

He says that he's always enjoyed travelling

He told me that she had recommended this program to him

He decided to become a professional musician

I've just come home

The lesson has already begun

Listen! Someone is hitting the door

He recommended this video to me

He said that he had expressed his personal point of view

We often exchanged our ideas
