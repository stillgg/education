If I earn enough money, I'll be able to buy it

If you train more intensively, you'll show a much better result

If nothing changes, the situation will be very unpleasant

If you don't hurry up, you'll be late

If it rains, I'll stay at home

If the situation doesn't improve, they'll need to take some urgent measures

If I have free time, I usually devote it to my hobbies

If it rains, I usually stay at home

If he calls me, I'll be very surprised

She'll be very disappointed, if she knows it

When you train too much, you get tired very quickly

I get tired if I work too much

If water reaches one hundred degrees, it boils

If everything remains the same, nothing good will happen

He'll be shocked, if he knows the truth

If it rains, they can cancel the match

If you study really hard, you'll pass the exam

When I have free time, I usually devote it to my family

If I learn English regularly, I feal real progress

If it happen, it'll be very strange
