It seems to me that the water is boiling

He left from Russia last year

How do you prefer to spend your free time

She said that he had gone home

Someone called him when he was going home

react to

He said that she had reacted to these words very strangely

suggest

I suggest going for a walk

I suggest meeting tonight

He's just invited me to this party

He appeared at the end of the party

These clothes fit him perfectly

The dress fit her perfectly

They've just repaired the roof

I really hate doing it

I've always admired this kind of people

I knew that he had died very young

Who does it belong to now?

Who does it depend on now?

I trust him completely

I asked him to repeat this question

I met him while I was walking in the park

I was studying all day

He's just flown to the United States

Don't touch it
