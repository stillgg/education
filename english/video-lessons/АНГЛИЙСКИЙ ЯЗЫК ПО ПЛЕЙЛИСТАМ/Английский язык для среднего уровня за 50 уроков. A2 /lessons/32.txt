I was really surprised when I found out that I had taken the first place

I'm not going to complain about it

They've decreased the price this year

I want to tell you that I overcame all those difficulties

I decided to relax a bit

Have you ever visited an English-speaking country

While he was sleeping they were watching a movie

He invested about ten thousand dollars in this project

He laid the book on the floor

I'm still using this application because it seems incredibly useful

He refused to answer this question

I've just finished my work

I've just set up this program

To be honest I've never thought about it

I managed to overcame all these difficulties

He said that it had already happened

While she was dancing, he was watching her

They've recorded a new album this year

I decided to relax a little

I managed to pass this test

He forgot to brush his teeth

I want to say that I approve of this decision
