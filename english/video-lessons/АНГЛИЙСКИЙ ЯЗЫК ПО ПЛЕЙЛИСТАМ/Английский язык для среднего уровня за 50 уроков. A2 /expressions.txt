proper measures

to be honest

one day

a thousand times

fall asleep

to tell the truth

money to live on

money for a living

get out of control

by the time

tell me a lie

been to

live up to someone expectations

matter of practice

with the help of

strong health

It's hard to believe 

in someone arms

punish

come into

lie down

It seems to me that it develops our analytical abilities

I was staying at home all day

When did he graduate from university?

When I noticed him, he was looking for something

I disagree with this statement now

I divided this sum of money into three parts

I was at home all day

I haven't prepared for this test yet

He lay down at the end of the day

Why is he smiling

He discovered that someone had stolen his bag

The teacher divided our group into several parts

I decided not to follow this recommendation

Such an example really motivates me

While I was preparing for this test really hard, they weren't thinking about it really seriously

I've just arrived at the meeting

I remember how it happened

I've testet my knowledge yet

I think that we're wasting time now

Did you wash the dishes

What are you looking for

I discovered that they had given me the wrong information

He said that they had destroyed the building completely

It was getting darker and we decided to turn back home
